# mTracker

This is a very basic mail tracking service which I developed for my personal use.

To see it working, visit [mTracker](https://https://emailtrack.herokuapp.com/)

You can read about the project in my [blog](https://prashants.in/blog/python-flask-e-mail-tracker/)

## How to use it:

3. Get the HTML code

4. Add the HTML code to your mail body HTML. [This video](https://youtu.be/MsMSqhMlfao) will help you.

5. Send your email.

Now when the receiver opens your email, you will get an email
